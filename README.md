# RISKS & VULNERABILITIES

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on developing a sensor-based monitoring strategy to detect threats and support operational awareness across key systems in a simulated enterprise environment. Using Paessler PRTG, I identified and prioritized sensors for systems such as a SQL database, Linux development server, and IIS web server. Each sensor was evaluated based on its connection to known indicators of compromise (IoCs), expected behavior, and system criticality.

The project includes a structured analysis of each sensor's role, alert thresholds, and justification based on potential risks. 

Additional recommendations were made to improve monitoring coverage, including the use of a web application firewall, privilege escalation detection, and multi-factor authentication. 

## Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze and recommend monitoring sensors for key business systems, based on threat relevance and risk exposure. Each sensor was assessed for its ability to detect specific IoCs and was prioritized according to system importance. Thresholds were proposed to balance alert effectiveness with operational usability. The project also includes recommendations for improving monitoring coverage and supporting broader governance and security objectives.

### Skills Learned

- Evaluated and prioritized monitoring sensors based on risk relevance and asset criticality.
- Mapped Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to specific system behaviors and monitoring points.
- Defined alert thresholds in the context of risk tolerance and operational impact.
- Communicated findings through structured reporting and a stakeholder-focused presentation
  
### Tools & Technologies Used

- Paessler PRTG: Network and system monitoring platform
- MITRE ATT&CK: Mapping the behavior of threats
- CVE Details & NIST NVD: Vulnerability reference for sensor justification
