# 🔍 Risk Monitoring with Sensors & Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)

## 📝 Executive Summary

This project focused on creating a monitoring strategy using sensors to detect risks across key business systems in a lab environment. I selected sensors for an SQL database, Linux development server, and IIS web server using Paessler PRTG. Each sensor was mapped to known threat indicators and ranked based on system criticality and data sensitivity.

The report included a sensor mapping table, threshold recommendations, and a summary presentation for executive leadership. This project supports early detection, asset protection, and compliance with monitoring best practices.

## 🎯 Objective

To evaluate monitoring sensors and recommend those best suited for detecting suspicious activity across key systems. Each sensor was linked to relevant IoCs, assigned a priority, and given a threshold recommendation to reduce false positives while enabling timely response.

## 🔄 Steps Taken

1. Reviewed the organization’s system setup and identified three critical assets  
2. Researched threats and indicators of compromise relevant to each system  
3. Selected appropriate sensors in Paessler PRTG based on risk exposure and asset value  
4. Mapped each sensor to known IoCs and justified their placement in a sensor table  
5. Assigned priority levels to sensors and defined alert thresholds to reduce noise  
6. Linked sensor actions to applicable security frameworks (e.g., NIST, ISO 27001)  
7. Compiled a report and created a short slide presentation to summarize key findings
