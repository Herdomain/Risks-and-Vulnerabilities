# RISKS & VULNERABILITIES

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on developing a sensor-based monitoring strategy to detect threats and support operational awareness across key systems in a simulated enterprise environment. Using Paessler PRTG, I identified and prioritized sensors for systems such as a SQL database, Linux development server, and IIS web server. Each sensor was evaluated based on its connection to known indicators of compromise (IoCs), expected behavior, and system criticality.

The project includes a structured analysis of each sensor's role, alert thresholds, and justification based on potential risks. 

Additional recommendations were made to improve monitoring coverage, including the use of a web application firewall, privilege escalation detection, and multi-factor authentication. 

## Objective

The goal of this project was to review and recommend monitoring sensors for important business systems. Each sensor was chosen based on the type of threat it can detect and how critical the system is. I also set alert thresholds to make sure they are useful without causing too many false alarms. The project includes suggestions for adding more monitoring to improve overall security and support company policies and risk management goals.

### Skills Learned

- Evaluated and prioritized monitoring sensors based on risk relevance and asset criticality.
- Mapped Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) to specific system behaviors and monitoring points.
- Defined alert thresholds in the context of risk tolerance and operational impact.
- Communicated findings through structured reporting and a stakeholder-focused presentation
  
### Tools & Technologies Used

- Paessler PRTG: Network and system monitoring platform
- MITRE ATT&CK: Mapping the behavior of threats
- CVE Details & NIST NVD: Vulnerability reference for sensor justification
